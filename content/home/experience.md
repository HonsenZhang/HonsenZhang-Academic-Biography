    company: High dynamic obstacle avoidance technology of 5G network-connected UAV
    company_url: ''
    location: (National Engineering Laboratory of Big Data Application Technology for Air, Space, Ground and Sea Integration, NPU)
    date_start: '2020-07-10'
    date_end: '2020-08-20'

        * A method of removing self movement from the stream of events proposed by Mitrokhin etc. was referenced. A density-based clustering algorithm and self-trained neural network were used to segment the target obstacles. Finally, the speed of the obstacle is calculated by the optical flow method, so that the UAV can avoid obstacles.
        * Establish a rapid obstacle avoidance system of the UAV, use an event camera (an open simulation data set) to conduct the environment perception of the unmanned system, reduce the environment perception time of the unmanned system to level 10MS.
